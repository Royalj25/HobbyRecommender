## Notes

- The program transforms each piece of input using a combination of **letter selection, numeric operations, and string formatting**.  
- Spaces are removed and certain letters (`O`, `o`, `I`, `i`) are excluded to create a **unique identifier string**.  
- All other inputs will generate a similar string, following the same rules.
